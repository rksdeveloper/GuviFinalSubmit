## 1. Introduction
The Learning Management System (LMS) project is a GUI-based application developed in Java using Swing. It provides an interactive platform for administrators, instructors, and students to manage and engage with educational resources.

### Purpose:
The primary goal is to simplify the management of educational tasks, such as course creation, enrollment, and student performance tracking.

---

## 2. Project Objectives
- Create a user-friendly GUI application for managing learning resources.
- Implement separate dashboards for administrators, instructors, and students.
- Ensure error handling, data validation, and integration of components.

---

## 3. System Architecture
### Layers:
1. **User Interface:** Java Swing is used to create interactive GUIs.
2. **Logic Layer:** Handles user authentication, role-specific actions, and event handling.
3. **Data Layer:** Currently uses hardcoded data but is designed for easy integration with databases.

## 4. Features and Functionalities
### Admin:
- **Manage Users:** Add, edit, and delete users.
- **Manage Courses:** Create and organize courses.
- **System Analytics:** View system performance reports.

### Instructor:
- **Create Courses:** Design courses and add materials.
- **Quizzes and Assignments:** Develop and assign quizzes.
- **Monitor Student Performance:** Track student progress and grades.

### Student:
- **Enroll in Courses:** Browse and join available courses.
- **Access Materials:** View lectures, quizzes, and assignments.
- **Track Progress:** Monitor grades and progress.
